                <p align="center"><font size="5">Here is the description of CCS that you can find on their website: </font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">My Work Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Although, I was returning to a company I had worked for in the past, I was going into a very different role that would have me experiencing a different aspect of working in IT. My main role was monitoring security related tickets and systems, while also working on access management related projects.</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">CCS covers many fields of computer science such as networking and enterprise applications, with our section involving Information Security. I primarily worked on the Third floor of the UC next to the access management analysts.</font></p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="block_title">Goals</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Going into my third term with CCS I was unsure of what to expect because, Although I had a rough idea of what an Information Security Analyst does, I was new to this environment and the amount of responsibility I knew I would have. That being said by the end I had two goals that I was working towards: </font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Oral Communication</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Having previously worked in a role that heavily involved oral communication you would think that I was done with developing this skill, I thought so too, but I was wrong! When we think of Oral communication  we often think of it in two senarios. One on one conversation/interaction or presentations. I had strong one on one communication thanks to my previous experience but I had very little practice with presnting information to groups. This term near the end I was given the oppourtunity to practice this skill in the form of a presentation that I would give to the Team I work with about the Project I had worked on for the 8 months I had worked there. At first this had proved nerve wracking as I was mainly nervous that something would not work correctly while demoing my program. Despite this I believe I was able to gain more confidence through this oppourtunity and would deem this short term goal as a success.</font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Security Awareness</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Given my previous experience working at the IT Help Centre I had a base knowledge of what Cyber Security was and what could be involved, that being said I was far from being perfect when it came to my security practices. This jopb helped me quite a bit in improving my personal and professional security practices. One major thing I started to incorporate in my day to day life was the use of a password manager whikch I find greatly increases my security level. Along with security practices I also try to keep up with security news as it came along with tips from my manager I was able to setup several feeds that i would check daily for the latest in security news.</font></p>

                <h2 class="block_title">Job Description</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Here is the job description posted on the job ad before my application: </font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"As a Student Consultant you will work closely with CCS IT staff to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to our clients within the University. In the Help Center and at the IT Help Desk you will answer questions about CCS Services and applications, supported products and a wide variety of computing issues including network connectivity, email software/Gryph mail and virus/malware problems. As a Student Consultant you will be exposed to technology and IT service areas including Network Infrastructure, Security, Directory Services and a number of campus-wide applications. This position provides staff with the opportunity to develop critical customer service skills, analytical and troubleshooting skills.  Student Consultants will also assist with the creation of customer and web documentation and there may be opportunities to work on special projects with other CCS teams."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">At My new Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The above description gives a basic representation of what it is like to work at the CCS Help Centre. Last time I worked here as a Coop student we supported the staff/grad migration to office 365, this time it was the undergrad turn. The University had a large mail migration of all the Undergrad email accounts to Office 365, which, with my newly gained experience, I believe it went fairly smoothly, although we are still feeling the affects from the migration with the return of all the students. With the support of our supervisor Jill we were able to make it through the other side extremely knowledgable in the basic and advanced use of the new mail system.</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Software Burning Station</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">A few other changes we had to support were the modification of wifi at the University and the implementation of wifi in the residences for all the new students starting in the fall. This entailed learning some new processes and devices, namely the new AP's that were installed into the rooms. One skill needed for this job was adaptability which we definitely learned on the job as we worked with the support of full time staff and each other, we were able to take anything in stride and support all clients, no matter how upset they were at the various changes made at the University.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Help Centre</font></p>


                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The main form of communication we had with clients was phone and email through a ticketing system. These were not too hard to use and we learned very quickly. This enabled us to focus on the actual problem solving and how to communicate solutions in a way that our clients would understand. Throughout the day we would recieve many issues, including password resets/unlocks, internet/network troubleshooting, mail set up, adminstration tasks such as voicemail resets, and many more requests/issues. This required me to expand my knowledge in IT and diversify what I know to be able to help with any issue coming into the queue.</font></p>

I look forward to continue working here as a part time student in the new semester and only hope to develop and build on top of all these valuable skills that I have created and worked on for the past 4 months.</font></p>
