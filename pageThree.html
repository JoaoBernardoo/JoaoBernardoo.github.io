                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">My Work Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Although, I was returning to a company I had worked for in the past, I was going into a very different role that would have me experiencing a different aspect of working in IT. My main role was monitoring security related tickets and systems, while also working on access management related projects.</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">CCS covers many fields of computer science such as networking and enterprise applications, with our section involving Information Security. I primarily worked on the Third floor of the UC next to the access management analysts.</font></p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="block_title">Goals</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Going into my third term with CCS I was unsure of what to expect because, Although I had a rough idea of what an Information Security Analyst does, I was new to this environment and the amount of responsibility I knew I would have. That being said by the end I had two goals that I was working towards: </font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Oral Communication</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Having previously worked in a role that heavily involved oral communication you would think that I was done with developing this skill, I thought so too, but I was wrong! When we think of Oral communication  we often think of it in two senarios. One on one conversation/interaction or presentations. I had strong one on one communication thanks to my previous experience but I had very little practice with presnting information to groups. This term near the end I was given the oppourtunity to practice this skill in the form of a presentation that I would give to the Team I work with about the Project I had worked on for the 8 months I had worked there. At first this had proved nerve wracking as I was mainly nervous that something would not work correctly while demoing my program. Despite this I believe I was able to gain more confidence through this oppourtunity and would deem this short term goal as a success.</font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Security Awareness</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Given my previous experience working at the IT Help Centre I had a base knowledge of what Cyber Security was and what could be involved, that being said I was far from being perfect when it came to my security practices. This jopb helped me quite a bit in improving my personal and professional security practices. One major thing I started to incorporate in my day to day life was the use of a password manager whikch I find greatly increases my security level. Along with security practices I also try to keep up with security news as it came along with tips from my manager I was able to setup several feeds that i would check daily for the latest in security news.</font></p>

                <h2 class="block_title">Job Description</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Here is the job description posted on the job ad before my application: </font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"Reporting to Manager, Information Security the successful co-op student will join the team responsible for cyber security services and identity management at the University of Guelph. The responsibilities of this position will include: Triage of Information Security tickets and incidents related to security and University account issues, Working with customers via email, phone, and in person to understand and resolve problems, Monitoring the information security services for anomalies and threats, Monitoring information security related feeds to stay current on security updates, vulnerabilities, current attacks, and trends, Assisting with the automation of tasks to enhance, streamline, and improve processes, Writing, reviewing, and creating documentation for Information Security tasks and procedures, Other related duties as assigned."</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The above description gives a basic representation of what I needed to do while working with the Information Security Team. My everyday responsibilities would be checking our ticket queue in the morning and complpeting any tickets that I could. These tickets could range from network scan reports to email scam reports. Another thing that I would do daily aswell was monitor the universities Quarantine email account which houses messages that are potentially malicious that is trying to make its way to university users, so that I can determine whether they are in fact malicious or not.</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Apart from my operational duties I also had project work that I was given to help out the Identity management team. The large paroject I was given that I just complepted by the end of my ter, was a locking/unlocking script used to facilitate the account locking process, so admins locking acounts can do so from one places as opposed to the multiple other places they needed to in the past. Other than this project there were a few other projects that I was working on through out that introduced me to other forms of programmiong that I had not experinced in the past, including but not limited to BASH and powershell.</font></p>
