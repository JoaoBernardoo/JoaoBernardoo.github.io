                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"CCS provides core IT services to the greater campus community. These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">My Work Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">While, this time around, I was doing much of the same work, which includes general IT aid to clients within the University, I was also involved heavily in helping to train the new co-op's throughout the summer semester. I helped them to learn all of the basics involved in the job and gave the the tools and the mindset for the more complex tasks they would encounter later.</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">CCS covers many fields of computer science such as networking and security, with our section involving information technology. We primarily worked in the basement of Johsnton Hall in the Help Centre while working at the Library periodically.</font></p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="block_title">Goals</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">My focus when returning to CCS for my second term, was to hone the fine details of my IT Skills while also developing my leadership and teamwork skills. This proved difficult but definetly doable as I found myself really perfecting my skills as I have continuously worked here. The following are some of the goals that I had made for the job and how I worked towards them: </font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Leadership</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">As this is my second term as an IT Specialist in CCS, I could confidently say that my communiction skill had been sharpened quite well, which is why I moved my focus from communication to leadership. I knew that this term would require a measure of leadership from me as I would help my supervisor Jill train the Coop students along with a few others so that they wouldn't be thrown into the deep end without knowing how to swim. In order to improve in this regard I had to set in my mind different things I could do to improve my leadership skills from the last term. I decided that I would make sure to help the new Coops know when they had made mistakes and how they could fix them correctly. A vital step in this training process was helping them realise that is ok to ask questions, as this job is very depndant on teamwork. This leads to my second goal of improving my teamwork espicially with those less experienced as me. I wanted to be able to take criticism from the new Coop students as they also bring their own experience to the table. This meant not letting my own experience get to my head. I believe that I have completed this goal as the new Coop students are doing so well and continually improving in their work.</font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Initiative/Creativity</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Since, this time around I had much more experince I would have more down time as I would be able to help finish work faster. With this newly gained time, I wanted to be more proactive in project work that my supervisor gave us. This was definetly a challenge as sometimes you don't know where to start when it comes to project work. Together, the new Coops and I, divided up the work given to us and we worked away at it to see it through. We did not finish all the work given to us, but we did alot of it and helped to improve that work environment for the retunring Part Time students in the Fall Semester. One of the project that I made Included a shift randomizer catered to the needs of the Coops in the Help Centre. In the end I believe I could have done more in this regard but was glad that I ultimately helped the new Coops complete their tasks.</font></p>

                <h2 class="block_title">Job Description</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Here is the job description posted on the job ad before my application: </font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"As a Student Consultant you will work closely with CCS IT staff to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to our clients within the University. In the Help Center and at the IT Help Desk you will answer questions about CCS Services and applications, supported products and a wide variety of computing issues including network connectivity, email software/Gryph mail and virus/malware problems. As a Student Consultant you will be exposed to technology and IT service areas including Network Infrastructure, Security, Directory Services and a number of campus-wide applications. This position provides staff with the opportunity to develop critical customer service skills, analytical and troubleshooting skills.  Student Consultants will also assist with the creation of customer and web documentation and there may be opportunities to work on special projects with other CCS teams."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">At My new Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The above description gives a basic representation of what it is like to work at the CCS Help Centre. Last time I worked here as a Coop student we supported the staff/grad migration to office 365, this time it was the undergrad turn. The University had a large mail migration of all the Undergrad email accounts to Office 365, which, with my newly gained experience, I believe it went fairly smoothly, although we are still feeling the affects from the migration with the return of all the students. With the support of our supervisor Jill we were able to make it through the other side extremely knowledgable in the basic and advanced use of the new mail system.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Software Burning Station</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">A few other changes we had to support were the modification of wifi at the University and the implementation of wifi in the residences for all the new students starting in the fall. This entailed learning some new processes and devices, namely the new AP's that were installed into the rooms. One skill needed for this job was adaptability which we definitely learned on the job as we worked with the support of full time staff and each other, we were able to take anything in stride and support all clients, no matter how upset they were at the various changes made at the University.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Help Centre</font></p>


                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The main form of communication we had with clients was phone and email through a ticketing system. These were not too hard to use and we learned very quickly. This enabled us to focus on the actual problem solving and how to communicate solutions in a way that our clients would understand. Throughout the day we would recieve many issues, including password resets/unlocks, internet/network troubleshooting, mail set up, adminstration tasks such as voicemail resets, and many more requests/issues. This required me to expand my knowledge in IT and diversify what I know to be able to help with any issue coming into the queue.</font></p>

I look forward to continue working here as a part time student in the new semester and only hope to develop and build on top of all these valuable skills that I have created and worked on for the past 4 months.</font></p>
