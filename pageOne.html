These include internet connectivity, a campus wide integrated email and calendaring system, telephony infrastructure, software distribution, development of single sign-on technology, learning resources, and more."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">My Work Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">As the company that provides IT support for the entirety of the university CCS is tasked with taking on hundreds of issues and requests daily; this can range from helping a retiree clear there cache and cookies, to restablshing a service like secure wifi after a campus wide outage.</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">CCS covers many fields of computer science such as networking and security, with our section involving information technology. We primarily worked in the basement of Johsnton Hall in the Help Centre while working at the Library periodically.</font></p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2 class="block_title">Goals</h2>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Going into this co-op placement I knew that my prior customer service experience would prove useful, but I could not anticipate the amount of customer service CCS went through on a daily basis. This being the case, I was able to quickly develop some goals of my own in order to be the best that I could be at this placement. The following are some of the goals that I had made for the job and how I worked towards them: </font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Communication</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Coming into this job I already had strong phone communication skills due to my prior experience in telemarketing. That being said my endurance was truly tested for communication on the phone while working at CCS. Therefore, I had to make a few communication goals after the first few weeks. Firstly, I wanted to improve my explanation skills because when trying to explain a UI over the phone it is vital that you know how to explain where things are and how things are done especially when dealing with clients who had little to no experience with computers. Secondly, I had the goal of improving my email writing skills so that I would have no errors in my emails to clients. This was something I truly struggled with at the beginning since I rarely wrote emails in the past. Through lots of practice while at work I naturally became better to the point of having virtually no errors in my emails. The communication I was doing was not only external but internal as well, whether it be with my team mates or with internal teams of full time staff. I truly improved in working in a company with many different types of people who have different technical backgrounds. By the end of my 8 months I felt that I was much better at communication and think this experience will truly aid me in any of my future placements.</font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Problem Solving</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">This placement truly stressed the need for problem solving skills. Most jobs do need, at some level, basic problem solving, but while working at CCS I was in the front line IT support. This means that you really need to be able to receive an issue that you have never heard of, and be able to work through it to find a workaround, if not a solution. This being as it was, I had a very large goal of dramatically improving my problem solving skills. I worked towards this by watching and listening to how others would solve issues, and I asked ALOT of questions and conducted alot of research along with the other three co-op students. I found that problem solving did not have to be a one person job and that often it was best to step back and check with the team on what they would do in this situation and often this lead to many problems being solved and having everyone on the same page for common issues. Us as co-ops grew so much in this regard, that many times we were now being asked by the part timers for help on issues that were foreign to them such as the mechanics of Microsoft outlook and all the other new processes developed during our work term.</font></p>

                <br>

                <u><b><p align="center"><font size="5">Leadership</font></p></b></u>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Before working at the CCS Help Centre I would have never thought of myself as a leader, nor did I think I had what it took to be one. Once we were done our summer semester and the part time student workers came back and were working again, the co-op team found that we had to assume the role of leaders in order to help get everyone up to speed. This is mostly because there were many major changes in the summer that affected our job as front line support. Being a leader in this regard included helping the part time staff with how to do certain things, inform them of the new procedures and make sure they were doing this correctly. I also learned that being a leader is something that requires you to take input from the people you are leading, because they will often know how to do things better than you and you have to use this as well as let the other team members know in order to provide the best experience to the clients. I truly feel that I learned how to be a good leader through this placement.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">Here is the job description posted on the job ad before my application: </font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">"As a Student Consultant you will work closely with CCS IT staff to provide technical troubleshooting, IT information and IT solutions to our clients within the University. In the Help Center and at the IT Help Desk you will answer questions about CCS Services and applications, supported products and a wide variety of computing issues including network connectivity, email software/Gryph mail and virus/malware problems. As a Student Consultant you will be exposed to technology and IT service areas including Network Infrastructure, Security, Directory Services and a number of campus-wide applications. This position provides staff with the opportunity to develop critical customer service skills, analytical and troubleshooting skills.  Student Consultants will also assist with the creation of customer and web documentation and there may be opportunities to work on special projects with other CCS teams."</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">At My Old Desk</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The above description gives a basic representation of what it is like to work at the CCS Help Centre. One large thing that we did not expect as the co-op team is that so much would be changing at the University over the summer while we were in the first four months of our co-op term. The University had a large mail migration of all the staff and grad email accounts to Office 365, which proved to be a huge task to support as we were thrown into this new email system, which we had to learn so that we could answer any questions related to this. With the support of our supervisor Jill we were able to make it through the other side extremely knowledgable in the basic and advanced use of the new mail system.</font></p>

                <center><img src="assets/images/20161213_142125.jpg" alt="my desk" width="664" height="373.5"></center>
                <p align="center"><font size="5">Software Burning Station</font></p>

                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">A few other changes we had to support were the modification of guest wifi at the University and the implementation of wifi in the residences for all the new students starting in the fall. This entailed learning some new processes and devices, namely the new AP's that were installed into the rooms. One skill needed for this job was adaptability which we definitely learned on the job as we worked with the support of full time staff and each other, we were able to take anything in stride and support all clients, no matter how upset they were at the various changes made at the University.</font></p>

                <br>

                <center><img src="assets/images/20161213_142046.jpg" alt="my desk" width="664" height="373.5"></center>
                <p align="center"><font size="5">Help Centre</font></p>


                <br>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">The main form of communication we had with clients was phone and email through a ticketing system. These were not too hard to use and we learned very quickly. This enabled us to focus on the actual problem solving and how to communicate solutions in a way that our clients would understand. Throughout the day we would recieve many issues, including password resets/unlocks, internet/network troubleshooting, mail set up, adminstration tasks such as voicemail resets, and many more requests/issues. This required me to expand my knowledge in IT and diversify what I know to be able to help with any issue coming into the queue.</font></p>

                <p align="center"><font size="5">In conclusion, I gained more experience than I could have ever hoped for at this placement. I gained all the soft skills you would need for any job, but especially IT and dev work, this includes teamwork, customer service, leadership, and communication to name a few. I look forward to continue working here as a part time student in the new semester and only hope to develop and build on top of all these valuable skills that I have created and worked on for the past 8 months.</font></p>
